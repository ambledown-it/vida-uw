# Dashboard Data Fetching Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the recommended pattern for implementing data fetching and filtering across dashboard visualizations. The architecture optimizes for:

- Centralized filter state management
- Efficient server-side filtering and aggregation
- Minimized network requests
- Responsive UI experience
- Support for multiple dashboard views/tabs

## Core Architecture

### 1. Filter State Management

Maintain a centralized filter state store with these characteristics:

- Global filters that affect all dashboards
- Dashboard-specific filters that only apply to particular views
- Support for filter persistence across navigation
- Methods for filter reset and bulk updates

```javascript
// Example structure (implementation-agnostic)
{
  global: {
    dateRange: { start: Date, end: Date },
    refreshInterval: number
  },
  dashboardSpecific: {
    sales: {
      channels: string[],
      categories: string[]
    },
    performance: {
      metrics: string[],
      compareWithPrevious: boolean
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Query Pattern

For each dashboard, implement these query patterns:

#### Pattern A: Related Visualizations (Preferred)

When multiple charts display different views of the same underlying data:

1. Create a single endpoint that returns multiple aggregations
2. Use one query to fetch all related visualizations
3. Pass the appropriate segment to each chart component

This pattern minimizes network requests while keeping components decoupled.

#### Pattern B: Independent Visualizations

When charts display data from different domains:

1. Create separate query hooks for each visualization
2. Each hook should accept and apply relevant filters
3. Each hook should implement appropriate caching strategies

### 3. Dashboard Container Structure

```
DashboardContainer
├── FilterPanel (uses global and tab-specific filters)
├── TabNavigation
│   ├── Tab 1 (e.g., Sales Dashboard)
│   │   ├── Visualization Group A (uses Pattern A)
│   │   │   ├── Chart 1
│   │   │   └── Chart 2
│   │   └── Visualization B (uses Pattern B)
│   └── Tab 2 (e.g., Performance Dashboard)
│       └── ...
└── SharedComponents
    └── DateRangePicker, etc.
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Server-Side Considerations

1. Design endpoints that accept all relevant filter parameters
2. Implement server-side aggregation for all visualization data
3. Use database indexes on frequently filtered columns
4. Consider materialized views for complex, frequently-accessed visualizations
5. Implement appropriate caching headers

### Client-Side Optimizations

1. Debounce rapidly changing filters
2. Implement stale-while-revalidate caching
3. Show loading indicators during data fetching
4. Preserve and reuse filter state across tab navigation
5. Load dashboard tabs lazily to improve initial load time

### Multi-Tab Implementation

When implementing dashboards across multiple tabs:

1. Store active tab in application state
2. Preserve filter selections when switching tabs
3. Consider pre-fetching data for adjacent tabs
4. Implement tab-specific URL parameters for deep linking

## Error Handling

1. Implement robust error boundaries around visualization components
2. Provide fallback UI for failed data fetches
3. Add retry mechanisms for transient failures
4. Log detailed error information for debugging

## Performance Monitoring

1. Track response times for each visualization query
2. Monitor client-side rendering performance
3. Implement feature flags for gradual rollout of new visualizations
4. Set up alerts for slow-performing queries

This architecture provides a foundation for building responsive, maintainable dashboards with efficient data fetching patterns while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.
